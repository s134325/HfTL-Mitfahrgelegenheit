## Welcome to MiZe the "MitfahrZentrale" for HfTL

The goal of MiZe is to help students which are currently enroled in the HfTL to find trips from or to the HfTL.

## Current Versions

### API
0.0.1

### Frontend
coming soon ;)

## How-To:

### Calling the API
The base [URL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:URI_Euler_Diagram_no_lone_URIs.svg) for the API is [http://localhost:8080/trip](http://localhost:8080/trip). For more information how to call the API please see the section called Swagger-UI.

### Swagger-UI
MiZe integrates [swagger-core](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core) and [swagger-ui](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui). To have a look at the API just start the project on your local Tomcat, open up a browser of your choice and got to [http://localhost:8080/trip/swagger-ui/index.html](http://localhost:8080/trip/swagger-ui/index.html). If everything works as expected you should be able to see the API. In case you do not see the API you might want to try pasting [http://localhost:8080/trip/api-docs](http://localhost:8080/trip/api-docs) in the input field at the top and click explore. An api_key is not necessary at the moment (lucky you).

## More coming soon.
